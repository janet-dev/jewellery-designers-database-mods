CFG: SQL project improvements
<br><br>
CFG Project: MySQL database for a jewellery designer's store.
<br><br>
This is a MySQL relational database for a jewellery designer who hand crafts
her own designs. This was built for the Code First Girls 'Data & SQL' course June 2021.
<br><br>
Initially five tables were built with primary and foreign keys.
<br><br>
The queries and data analysis are outlined the file, 'Project Requirements.png'.
<br><br>
Some visual analysis can be seen in the 'G-Tableau' folder.
<br><br>
The initial build and project queries are in the file 'JDornan-silversmithUK-mods.sql'.
<br><br>
See the 'My EER Diagram.png' for the visual layout of the project.
<br><br>
The mysqldump is 'JewelleryStore_mods.sql' - use this to restore the database.<br>
For macOS machines see the instruction file 'mysqldump-macOS-mods.txt' of
