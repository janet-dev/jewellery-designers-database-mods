Janet’s notes for macOS Catalina v10.15.5
MySQL Workbench: 8.0 Build 8.0.22
Server: 8.0.24 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)

Note: macOS sometimes blocks the installing of current versions of software.
On this occasion I had to download a previous version of MySQL Server.

mysqldump
---------

On my macOS, mysqldump is found here on the Macintosh HD…

Applications/MySQLWorkbench.app/Contents/MacOS/

	mysql
	mysqldump
	MySQLWorkbench


Watch this YouTube clip first…

Open the macOS Terminal from the Launchpad.

Use cd to navigate to the directory where your database is. Mine is here…

janetsmac$ cd Documents/___NewCareer/__CodeFirstGirls/MySQL/MySQL-Project/

Point to where the mysqldump executable file is.

Mine is in /Applications/MySQLWorkbench.app/Contents/MacOS/  so I typed in…

janetsmac$ export PATH=${PATH}:/Applications/MySQLWorkbench.app/Contents/MacOS/

Log into the mysql Shell. (root is my SQL Server username)
NOTE: you may not see your entry. Make sure CAPS is not on & just trust your typing!!

janetsmac$ mysql -u root -p
	Enter password: <YOUR SQL SERVER PASSWORD>

You will see something like this..
	Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
	Your MySQL connection id is 1194
	Server version: 8.0.24 MySQL Community Server - GPL

Check to see if your database is here…

mysql> show databases ;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| PARTS              |
| performance_schema |
| pizza_customers    |
| SHOP               |
| silversmithUK_mods |
+--------------------+


Exit out of the mysql Shell, as mysqldump runs from the macOS Terminal…
mysql> exit


Run mysqldump from the macOS Terminal

janetsmac$ mysqldump -u root -p silversmithUK_mods > JewelleryStore_mods.sql
	Enter password: <YOUR SQL SERVER PASSWORD>

Check to see if the new file has been created…

janetsmac$ ls
	JewelleryStore_mods.sql

You can look at it using a text editor.
